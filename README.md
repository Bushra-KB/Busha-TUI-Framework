# Busha-TUI-Framework
A framework and libraries for developing a user interface using VGA text Mode(80x25)
## VGA Text Mode UI Framework for 8086 Microprocessor
This repository contains a framework and libraries for developing a user interface using VGA text mode (80x25) with the 8086 microprocessor. The project is implemented in 8086 assembly language, providing low-level control over the VGA hardware to create efficient and responsive text-based user interfaces. This framework serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with assembly language programming and VGA text mode graphics.
## What is Text-based user interface(TUI)?
<p>
  In computing, text-based user interfaces (TUI) (alternately terminal user interfaces, to reflect a dependence upon the properties of computer terminals and not just text), is a retronym describing a type of user interface (UI) common as an early form of human–computer interaction, before the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like <b>GUIs</b>, they may use the entire screen area and accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using special graphical characters such as ┌ and ╣, referred to in Unicode as the "box drawing" set. The modern context of use is usually a terminal emulator.

## Features

- **VGA Text Mode (80x25)**: Utilizes the VGA text mode for creating user interfaces.
- **8086 Assembly Language**: Implemented using 8086 assembly language for low-level hardware control.
- **Efficient and Responsive**: Designed to be efficient and responsive for text-based UI applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Assembler**: An assembler like NASM or MASM to compile the assembly code.
- **Emulator**: An emulator like emu8086, DOSBox to run the compiled code on modern systems.

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vga-text-mode-ui-framework.git
cd Busha-TUI-Framework
