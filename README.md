# Busha-TUI-Framework
A framework and libraries for developing a user interface using VGA text Mode(80x25)
## VGA Text Mode UI Framework for 8086 Microprocessor
This repository contains a framework and libraries for developing a user interface using VGA text mode (80x25) with the 8086 microprocessor. The project is implemented in 8086 assembly language, providing low-level control over the VGA hardware to create efficient and responsive text-based user interfaces. This framework serves as a valuable resource for learning and experimenting with assembly language programming and VGA text mode graphics.
## What is Text-based user interface(TUI)?
<p>
  In computing, text-based user interfaces (TUI) (alternately terminal user interfaces, to reflect a dependence upon the properties of computer terminals and not just text), is a retronym describing a type of user interface (UI) common as an early form of human–computer interaction, before the advent of graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Like <b>GUIs</b>, they may use the entire screen area and accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using special graphical characters such as ┌ and ╣, referred to in Unicode as the "box drawing" set. The modern context of use is usually a terminal emulator.
